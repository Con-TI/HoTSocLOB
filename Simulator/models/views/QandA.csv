We play a game with two tetrahedral dice red and blue each with faces labeled 1-4. In each turn you simultaneously roll both dice. If the blue shows more than the red you are paid the difference otherwise paid nothing. If the blue and red show the same value the game is immediately over otherwise you take another turn. What is 20x the fair value of the game?, 50
You and your friend each have a $100 bill. They could be real or fake with some unknown probability. Your friend will buy your bill for $20 or sell his to you for the same price. You can also bet any amount if the bills are real or not in either direction at a 1 to 1 payout. Given this what is the most amount of money you can guarantee?, 80
Alice and Bob start a game with a stack of n cards. Let n be chosen by rolling a fair 1000 sided die. On their turn each player will split the current stack of cards into two piles and discard the smaller pile. If both piles are the same size one pile is still discarded. If a player is unable to split the stack of cards on their turn they lose. If Alice goes first and both players play optimally what are the first 2dp of the probability that she wins?, 99

You are playing a 2D game where your character is trapped in a 6 × 6 grid. Your character starts at (1 1) and can only move down and right. There are two power-ups located at (2 3) and (4 6). How many possible paths can your character take to get to (6 6) such that it collects at least one power-up?, 131
Eight people from four married couples are randomly assigned to seats around a round table. What is 98x the expected number of couples that are seated next to each other?, 112
An urn containing 2 red and 1 blue orb is in front of you. At each step you will take out an orb uniformly at random and replace it with a blue orb regardless of the color selected. Find 24x the expected amount of draws needed until the urn contains only blue orbs., 108

There are six runners in the 100-yard dash. How many ways are there for three medals to be awarded if ties are possible (divide this by 10 and round to nearest integer)? (The runner or runners who finish with the fastest time receive gold medals the runner or runners who finish with exactly one runner ahead receive silver medals and the runner or runners who finish with exactly two runners ahead receive bronze medals.), 87
